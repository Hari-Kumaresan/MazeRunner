# MazeRunner

* Developed an algorithmic based calculator computing the most efficient route through a randomized maze using Djikstraâ€™s, Depth-First, and Breadth-First Searching Algorithms.
* Utilized vertex weighted graphs with advanced data structures (i.e. Queues, HashSets and HashMaps) to lead the selected algorithm route.
* Reduced run-time through employing Stacks holding Juncture objects to create the interactive maze as well as applying asynchronous Java threads to limit processor interruptions.
